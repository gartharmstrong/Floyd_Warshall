# FLOYD WARSHALL SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM

## INTRODUCTION
This projects contains a recursive and imperative Python implementation of the Floyd Warshall shortest path algorithm.

## INSTALLATION
- A Python console/IDE
- Review requirements.txt

## RUNNING THE CODE
In order to run each implementation, execute recursive_floyd.py or imperative_floyd.py in Python.
- The graph variable can be updated in each Python module to calculate different paths.
- The graph consists of 4 nodes as a matrix in Python.
- NO_PATH is used to define no path between nodes.

## TESTS
The project contains performance tests using brute force and timeit library.
Execute performance_test.py in Python. This will output timings for both imperative and recursive files
using both brute force and timeit.
